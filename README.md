✈️ Flight Delays & Cancellations Dashboard — Power BI ✈️

Proud to share my latest project where I stepped into the role of a Data Analyst for the Federal Aviation Administration!

Using a dataset of nearly 2 million commercial flights from major US airports, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover insights into flight delays and cancellations.

📊 Key Insights:

🛫 Top Delayed Airlines: Identified carriers with the most frequent delays.
📅 Worst Days for Travel: Analyzed which days of the week experienced the highest delay rates.
🌐 Airport Analysis: Highlighted airports with the most disruptions.
⚠️ Cancellation Causes: Explored reasons for flight cancellations — weather, carrier, or security issues.
🔧 Methods Used:

Power Query: Cleaned and transformed raw flight data.
DAX Calculations: Created custom metrics like Average Delay Time, Cancellation Rates, and Delay Causes Breakdown.
Interactive Visuals: Bar charts, line graphs, and heat maps for easy data exploration.
Dynamic Filters: Enabled drill-downs by airport, airline, day of the week, and delay type.
A big thank you to Maven Analytics for providing the tools and guidance to tackle real-world data challenges like this one. Your courses continue to elevate my data skills!
